# Penguify Store

This is a project made together with Kendra Hinz for Phi Beta Lambda competition. It is an ecommerce store which offers repurposed winter clothes for kids. Quick technical facts about the project:

- The website is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), a modern JavaScript library which allows creating SPAs. 
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) is used as the base environment. 
- The site was deployed with gh-pages. More information on the process can be found [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages).
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) is used to retrieve data from the json file (our primitive database). Here is the link to it:

```bash
https://penguify-pbl-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/products.json
```
## Full list of dependencies can be found in package.json file in this repository. 

## To clone the repo, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dimianni/penguify.git
```
NOTE: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) has to be installed globally on your machine. It is an environment which allows the execution of JavaScript locally on your machine.
